My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3152444500">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
We tend to blame ourselves for our everyday anxieties in society including unemployment, expensive healthcare, elderly care, not being able to pay for rent, not having good childcare and more. This book made me realize that so much of our anxieties are special to Americans and that our society is structured in a way that is anxiety-prone. <br /><br />Hear this: Finland (where the author is from) provides free higher education, nearly free healthcare, 10 month paid parental leave, cheap child care, a low-stress work week, paid summer vacations that last for 5 weeks, a hefty unemployment insurance, the freedom to pursue art/creative careers, pensions, and more.<br /><br />Imagine how people's anxieties would differ if we weren't stuck in the status quo.<br /><br />Across the most important areas of life. Family, work, education, health, love, money --people in Nordic societies enjoy forms of individualism, freedom, social mobility, and independence from societal obligations that make them more quintessentially 'American' than what Americans themselves today are generally able to experience. <br /><br />Nordic society allows people to have a basic floor (yes, healthcare and higher education is considered a 'right' in Finland) and to be able to provide an independent life free to anxieties that Americans have to face. <br /><br />Does this mean I vote for Bernie Sanders? Not necessarily<br />Does this mean I think we should have free health care ASAP? No <br />Does this mean we should emulate the Nordic Model? No<br /><br />Studying the Nordic model is an opportunity to pursue a deeper and more profound level of American-style individualism. All it requires is showing a little bit of faith in us and believe that there can be a society outside of the status quo.<br /><br />
