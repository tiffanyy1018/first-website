We tend to blame ourselves for our everyday anxieties in society including unemployment, expensive healthcare, elderly care, not being able to pay for rent, not having good childcare and more. This book made me realize that so much of our anxieties are special to Americans and that our society is structured in a way that is anxiety-prone. <br /><br />Hear this: Finland (where the author is from) provides free higher education, nearly free healthcare, 10 month paid parental leave, cheap child care, a low-stress work week, paid summer vacations that last for 5 weeks, a hefty unemployment insurance, the freedom to pursue art/creative careers, pensions, and more.<br /><br />Imagine how people's anxieties would differ if we weren't stuck in the status quo.<br /><br />Across the most important areas of life. Family, work, education, health, love, money --people in Nordic societies enjoy forms of individualism, freedom, social mobility, and independence from societal obligations that make them more quintessentially 'American' than what Americans themselves today are generally able to experience. <br /><br />Nordic society allows people to have a basic floor (yes, healthcare and higher education is considered a 'right' in Finland) and to be able to provide an independent life free to anxieties that Americans have to face. <br /><br />Does this mean I vote for Bernie Sanders? Not necessarily<br />Does this mean I think we should have free health care ASAP? No <br />Does this mean we should emulate the Nordic Model? No<br /><br />Studying the Nordic model is an opportunity to pursue a deeper and more profound level of American-style individualism. All it requires is showing a little bit of faith in us and believe that there can be a society outside of the status quo.<br /><br />

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3117457598">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Very Compelling - “Why a Universal Basic Income (UBI)?” Author Andy Stern’s supporting arguments span from a solid macroeconomic logic and his thorough understanding of the “Future of Work” that involve ‘replacement of workers’ and an increase in inequality due to what is the natural trajectory in technology, globalization, power of the elite, and etc in the 21st century. <br /><br />This book is a leading 21st century bipartisan thought-leadership piece on how we can solve poverty in the United States. As a political science/economics graduate who has read a lot of development literature, it is rare to find a book that not only states the issues at hand, but a solution, and a set of potential policies to follow. In the end, he lays out where the funding would come from, what other factors would have to be present, and what it’d take in politics to implement a UBI. <br /><br />From start to finish, this book was a page-turner and is very compelling. I would recommend this book to anyone at any stage of the UBI spectrum.
